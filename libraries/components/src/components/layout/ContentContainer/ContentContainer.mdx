# ContentContainer

"Hold me back."

<Preview>
	<Story id='layout-contentcontainer--base-width' />
</Preview>

## Extra-wide

Two additional, independently optional slots, one above and one below, can be filled with content that also gains a consistent gap between themselves and the main content of the section. Any content passed to these slots will also gain default responsive, horizontal alignment, which can be overridden at the child level.

	<Story id='layout-contentcontainer--extra-wide' />
</Preview>

## Full-width

A semantic headline with default styling and a `tag` that can be overridden.

	<Story id='layout-contentcontainer--full-width' />
